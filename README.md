# Ashtray Vibrant: VS Code Theme
###  A dark theme with vibrant syntax highlighting
This theme was inspired by Ray's Vibrant and Monokai Vibrant-like themes. This theme features a pure black code background, which makes the text easily visible in bright environments. The OLED black may also help with laptop battery life.

This theme is for VScode and comes in a .vsix format.
